**Food Hub Data Analysis**

**Overview**

The objective of this project was to analyze customer order data for Food Hub, a food delivery platform, to uncover insights related to customer behavior, restaurant performance, and order characteristics. Using Python for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization, this project focused on identifying trends that could help Food Hub improve customer satisfaction and operational decision-making.

The analysis examined factors such as order value, cuisine type, delivery time, ratings, and customer feedback. Key insights highlighted relationships between delivery duration, food ratings, and overall customer satisfaction, helping stakeholders better understand what drives positive customer experiences.

**Business Understanding**

Food delivery platforms operate in a highly competitive market where customer retention is strongly influenced by delivery speed, food quality, and service reliability. Understanding which factors contribute most to higher ratings and repeat purchases is critical for improving platform performance.

This analysis aimed to answer business questions such as:

What characteristics are associated with higher customer ratings?

How do delivery time and order value impact customer satisfaction?

Which restaurant or cuisine attributes are linked to better performance?

The insights from this project can support Food Hub in improving vendor partnerships, optimizing delivery operations, and enhancing the overall customer experience.

**Data Understanding**

The dataset contained order-level data from Food Hub, including customer ratings, delivery times, order costs, cuisine types, and restaurant information. The data consisted of multiple numerical and categorical features representing both operational and customer-facing metrics.

Initial exploration focused on understanding data distributions, identifying missing values, and detecting outliers. Several variables were reformatted into appropriate data types, and unnecessary or redundant columns were removed to ensure data quality and consistency.

Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

Key data preparation steps included:

Handling missing and inconsistent values

Converting categorical variables into analyzable formats

Creating derived features such as delivery time categories and order value groupings

Filtering and cleaning data to ensure reliable analysis

These steps helped create a clean and structured dataset suitable for exploratory analysis and insight generation.

**Analysis & Evaluation**

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques such as descriptive statistics, bar charts, and distribution plots were used to identify patterns and relationships in the data. The analysis revealed notable trends between delivery time, order cost, and customer ratings.

Visualizations helped highlight:

How delivery duration impacts customer satisfaction

The relationship between food ratings and overall order ratings

Differences in performance across cuisine types and restaurants

These insights provide actionable guidance for improving service quality and operational efficiency.

**Conclusion**

This analysis provided valuable insights into the drivers of customer satisfaction on the Food Hub platform. Results suggest that timely delivery and consistent food quality play a significant role in achieving higher customer ratings.

Future work could include:

Building predictive models to estimate customer ratings or repeat purchase likelihood

Incorporating customer-level behavioral data for deeper personalization

Expanding the analysis to include time-based trends and seasonal effects

Overall, this project demonstrates how data analysis can support better business decisions in the food delivery industry.
